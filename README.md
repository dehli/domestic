Time to bring your state home.

## About

Global state management is great! Sometimes it's not... Domestic is a tiny library that simplifies local state management in clojurescript applications.

## Goals

- Make local state testing easy
- Flexible, works with all cljs libs that support reactive atoms (reagent, helix, etc...)

## Install
